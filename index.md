I’m Oybek Khodjaev — an independent systems transformation analyst examining AI governance.
For over 30 years, I have worked across finance, banking, government, and business, including serving as Deputy Governor of Samarkand Region. I witnessed the collapse of the Soviet Union from inside and have observed how large systems transform, lose control, and sometimes fail.
I independently study and closely observe the accelerating digital transformation of the world — from the early development of machine learning to deep learning and today’s rapid expansion of artificial intelligence. While acknowledging its undeniable benefits, I examine these developments with growing concern about their possible irreversible and potentially fatal consequences for institutions, governance, humanity, and the future of civilization.
Drawing on this experience, I write about how artificial intelligence is reshaping power dynamics, institutional control, and humanity’s ability to govern what it creates.
