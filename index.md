I'm Oybek Khodjaev — an independent systems transformation analyst examining AI governance.

For over thirty years, I have worked across finance, banking, government, and business, including serving as Deputy Governor of Samarkand Region and Deputy Chairman of the Management Board at JSC UzAgroIndustrialBank. I witnessed the collapse of the Soviet Union from the inside and have spent decades observing how large systems transform, lose control, and sometimes fail.

I write about how artificial intelligence is reshaping power dynamics, institutional control, and humanity's ability to govern what it creates. My perspective is unusual in this field: not a technologist or AI researcher, but a systems analyst who has watched governance frameworks succeed and collapse across thirty years of institutional practice in emerging markets.
