I'm Oybek Khodjaev — a systems transformation analyst examining AI governance.

## My journey:

Born in 1969 in Samarkand, I came of age during the final years of the Soviet Union. I witnessed Perestroika's promises and the USSR's collapse. I saw how institutions designed to last forever disintegrated in months.

For over 30 years, I've navigated systemic transitions:

- **Finance & Banking:** Deputy Chairman of the Board, Uzagroindustrialbank; leading roles in lending, treasury, investment, and risk management
- **Government:** Deputy Governor of Samarkand Region, overseeing investment and foreign trade
- **Private Sector:** Founder & CEO of INVEXI, advising on strategic transformations across CIS countries

## Why AI governance matters to me:

I bring a different perspective to AI governance.

I come from direct experience with institutional collapse and systemic transformation.

When I see today's AI governance debates, I recognize familiar patterns:
- Institutions claiming control they don't have
- Technical solutions to governance problems
- Performative transparency without accountability
- Belief that "this time is different"

I've seen this movie before. It doesn't end well.

## What I write about:

- How AI governance repeats patterns of failed institutional control
- Lessons from post-Soviet collapse applied to AI safety
- The gap between policy frameworks and power realities
- Why current AI governance approaches may accelerate — not prevent — loss of control

My analysis draws from direct experience with:
- Institutional collapse (USSR)
- Economic transformation (post-Soviet transitions)
- Observation and analysis of digital transformation processes within regional government systems
- Cross-sector governance (finance, government, private sector)

I don't have all the answers. I have questions shaped by watching systems fall apart.
