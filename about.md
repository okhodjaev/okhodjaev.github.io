I'm Oybek Khodjaev — a systems transformation analyst examining AI governance.

## Background

Born in 1969 in Samarkand (Uzbekistan), I came of age during the final years of the Soviet Union. I witnessed Perestroika's promises and the collapse of the USSR. I watched institutions designed to last forever disintegrate in months — and spent the following three decades working inside the systems that replaced them.

For over thirty years, I have navigated systemic transitions across finance, government, and the private sector:

**Finance & Banking:** Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and Treasury Director at JSC UzAgroIndustrialBank; leading roles in lending, currency operations, investment, and risk management across the CIS.

**Government:** Deputy Governor (Deputy Khokim) of Samarkand Region (2019–2022), overseeing investment attraction and foreign trade for a region of nearly four million people.

**Private Sector:** Founder & CEO of INVEXI LLC, advising on strategic transformations, foreign direct investment, and institutional reform across Uzbekistan and CIS countries.

## Why AI governance matters to me

My perspective on AI governance is shaped by direct experience with institutional collapse and systemic transformation — not by academic study of it.

When I examine today's AI governance frameworks, I recognize patterns I have watched operate before: institutions claiming control they do not have, technical solutions applied to governance problems, performative transparency without accountability, and the persistent belief that this time is structurally different.

The historical record suggests it rarely is. The mechanisms of institutional failure — the gap between declared authority and actual enforcement capacity — are remarkably consistent across contexts and decades.

## What I write about

I analyze how AI governance repeats patterns of failed institutional control, drawing on lessons from post-Soviet transformation, the 2008 financial crisis, and thirty years of practitioner experience across banking, government, and business.

My focus is not prediction but pattern recognition: identifying the structural mechanisms that produce governance failure before they produce governance collapse.

I do not have all the answers. I have questions shaped by watching systems fall apart — and occasionally, by watching them hold.
